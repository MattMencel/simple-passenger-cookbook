# `simple_passenger` Chef cookbook

[![Chef cookbook](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/simple_passenger.svg?maxAge=3600)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/simple_passenger) [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/atheiman/simple-passenger-cookbook.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://travis-ci.org/atheiman/simple-passenger-cookbook)

Chef cookbook to deploy a [Rack based Ruby web application](http://rack.github.io/) (Rails, Sinatra, etc) with
[Passenger standalone](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/config/standalone/).

# Usage

Pretty straightforward, this cookbook only has one required attribute. Specify
`['passenger']['git_repo']` pointing to your git repository (with the `.git` on the end) and call
the default recipe to run your app with passenger standalone.

This cookbook also creates a `Passengerfile.json` using the attributes under
`['passenger']['passengerfile']`. Refer to the
[`Passengerfile.json` reference](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/config/standalone/reference/)
and the [attributes](./attributes/) directory for help with these attributes.

# Testing

Unit tests are run on all pushes to GitHub by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/atheiman/simple-passenger-cookbook).

```shell
# install gem dependencies
bundle
# unit tests
bundle exec rspec
# integration tests
bundle exec kitchen test
```
